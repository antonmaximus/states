Fifty States
--------------
*"Look Ma, no jQuery!"*



**Author:** Anton

**Demo:** [fiddystates.herokuapp.com](http://fiddystates.herokuapp.com/)

**Description:**

This web application shows information for any of the 50 US states.

When a user types in on the search input, the JavaScript
code will make an AJAX request to the server.  The PHP server will find 
corresponding matches from its JSON file and return the results to the 
client-side to be displayed on the screen.  The user can then choose from the
displayed results using a mouse click, up/down arrow key, or return key.

In addition, the user can also directly click on a state in the image.  This
will provide the information of the state right away.

Some features of the app include: dynamic text bolding for input match, real-time
map highlights for matching entries, and a clear icon independent of browser.


**Technologies Used:**


Front-end: 
Raw JavaScript (i.e., no jQuery), AJAX, HTML/HAML, CSS/SCSS, SVG

Back-end:
